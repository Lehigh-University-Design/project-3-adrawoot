                    Coach Mike Krzyzewski, famously known as Coach K, and Kobe Bryant shared a profound respect and admiration for each
                    other that was forged on the basketball court during their time together with Team USA. Kobe thrived under Coach K’s
                    leadership during the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, where they won gold medals, showcasing a synergy that combined Kobe's
                    intense competitiveness with Coach K’s strategic acumen. Coach K often praised Kobe's work ethic and leadership
                    qualities, recognizing him as an instrumental force in revitalizing the national team. Kobe, in turn, respected Coach
                    K’s guidance and basketball knowledge, often referring to him as a mentor who enhanced his understanding of the game and
                    teamwork. Their relationship was built on mutual respect, shared goals, and a deep commitment to excellence, both on and
                    off the court.

Coack K summarised it as, “Kobe comes up and taps me on the shoulder and I said, ‘what’s up?’ Kobe replied, ‘I did what you asked me to do… And I cried…’ “ While describing the incident Coach K said that he got chills about how dedicated Kobe Bryant could be: “I said this guy owns it.” '; // Update the text content
